Musical Time Machine

A python program to create spotify playlist of your chosen date.
Go back in time and find out what were the top 100 songs of that time.

Note:
When you first run the program it'll open an agreement page. 
If you agree click on agree, and you'll be redirected to an example domain.
Copy the domain link from search bar and paste on the console (as it'll ask).
And you are good to go.
